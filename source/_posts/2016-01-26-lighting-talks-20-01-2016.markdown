[Let’s Encrypt](letsencrypt.org) is a free, automated, and open certificate authority (CA), run for the public’s benefit.

The idea behind this project is to push for a more secure, transparent and open web. It provides free TLS/SSL certificates in an automated way, developing all its tools as open source projects

**Freshshell**
 Your terminal is really personal thing: during your career you probably change its features with plugins, configuration and everything that can be useful for you. So why not automate the way you can configure it? Think what is happening every time you have a brand new you pc in front of you ... or even working with multiple computers (home, work).

**Boomerang, SOAP & REST Client**

It's a really powerful Chrome extension.
It lets you upload the WSDL and then you can create a request, it will create the structure for you and with the default values.
You can debug and save the requests and responses, change the http headers and parameters, and also you can use different types of authentication, import/export  to json file to save your projects.
