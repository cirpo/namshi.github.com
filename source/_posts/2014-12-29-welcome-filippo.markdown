2015 will bring some fresh air in our
backend team, since [Filippo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/filippodesantis)
is going to join us in the very first
days of the new year.

Filippo is an experienced PHP programmer
with a rock solid knowledge about OOP,
design patterns, TDD and best practices.
He was an early symfony adopter, starting
from version 1.0, and he contributed to
the [Symfony CMF project](https://github.com/symfony-cmf).

He is also an active member of several IT
communities in Italy, and  he is used to
share his experience as a speaker at
[meetups and conferences](http://www.slideshare.net/p16).
