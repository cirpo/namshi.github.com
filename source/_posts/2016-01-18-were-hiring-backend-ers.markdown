2016 has come...   ...time for new entries in the
[tech team](/team): what's better, to start the year
off, than new faces working on a [microservice-based SOA](http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html)
mostly powered by [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) running
through [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) containers?

<!-- more -->

Namshi is looking to beef its backend team up, with
solid engineers who can think of great solutions to
implement small, isolated, fault tolerant microservices
in our architecture: people who strive to write clean
code but also see the point of being pragmatic, who
know how to write automated tests but also know *when*
they might not be needed, who know when to abstract and
when too much abstraction is detrimental, who...
...well, you got the drill!

We mostly code in JavaScript, both on the frontend and
the backend, but, if you never got the chance to work with
it, don't worry: we believe that with the right mindset the
language won't matter that much -- in fact, these are a few
things we care about, and they're not platform-specific:

* you have designed and mantained HTTP APIs before
* know how to build fault-tolerance services that can run in high-availability setups
* crunch on DRY, KISS and YAGNI ([whaaaat?](http://www.itexico.com/blog/bid/99765/Software-Development-KISS-YAGNI-DRY-3-Principles-to-simplify-your-life))
* you are a detail-oriented, result-driven individual and are looking to grow in a multi-faceted environment
* allergic to monolithic architectures is a plus

We love to innovate and try to always follow the latest
trends in Web development -- here are some of the things
we did over the past couple of years:

* developed [isomorphic JavaScript apps](http://www.slideshare.net/unlucio/back-to-the-future-isomorphic-javascript-applications)
* deployed a fleet of [containers](https://www.docker.com/) through [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io/)
* been on the frontline to adopt SPDY -- now it's time to switch to HTTP/2
* have spent a substantial amount of time trying to help the [Open Source community](https://github.com/namshi)

Now we're playing around with React Native and Redux to see
if JavaScript could conquer the mobile apps landscape.

Our core team is based in Dubai but we're open to remote
candidates: you can find more about us by having a look
at our [open source libraries](https://github.com/namshi) or
scraping our [tech blog](http://tech.namshi.com).

If you think you could [fit into the team](http://tech.namshi.com/join-us/), drop us a line
at *work-in-tech@namshi.com* and let's make it happen!
