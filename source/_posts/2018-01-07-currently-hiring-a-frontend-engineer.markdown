Love React, React Native, the dom and webperf? Then we might have the right
opening for you!

<!-- more -->

It is no news that we've been banking on the JS ecosystem
for a few years: from rolling out our first angular apps in 2013 to using React
Native in our android app, we've been very busy trying to push our frontends
as far as possible.

We run a Service-Oriented architecture where JS plays a huge part: most of our
services are either SPAs or small NodeJS-backed APIs, and **JavaScript is king** at
Namshi.

We would like to work with someone who has a very strong background in the language,
who's been battling on the frontend for a few years and is not afraid to dive into
Node, if required.

Some of the things our frontend team has been working over the past few months:

* integrating React Native on our [android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.namshi.android)
* [improving conversion rate on our mobile website by 20%](/blog/2017/05/02/rebuilding-our-mobile-website/)
* releasing some interesting open-sourced [frontend](https://github.com/namshi/slim-slider) [bits](https://github.com/namshi/dollar-dom)

Most of our frontend apps are built with React, although some of the older apps
still kick it in angular boots. With a fleet of 100+ microservices, we're
generally very busy trying to innovate as much as possible.

Understand the inner workings of virtual dom? Think redux is not a replacement
for components' state? Grasp how HTTP/2 helps frontend developers?
Then we're definitely a match!

## Apply now!

P.S. A few weeks back I wrote a small piece about [Namshi's hiring process and *desiderata*](/blog/2016/12/06/get-that-job-at-namshi/),
give it a look!
