[Geshan](/team#Geshan Manandhar) has decided
he can't stand seeing people struggling with
crons anymore, therefore he decided to give it a
shot at the [2015 edition of the confoo](http://confoo.ca/en/call-for-papers/speaker/geshan-manandhar).

If you want to hear how Symfony integrates (so) nicely
with messaging queues and, specifically, with RabbitMQ
don't waste a second and [vote his talk](http://confoo.ca/en/call-for-papers/speaker/geshan-manandhar)
so that he can get the chance to take the stage at the
canadian conference.

He will talk about our **direct experience with RabbitMQ**,
including **MQ best practices** and an overview of the
available tools, so that the audience will be able to
understand the theory, see how it works in practice
and form his own opinion.

Well done Geshan, we hope to hear how Namshi handles
gazilions of messages in Canada!
