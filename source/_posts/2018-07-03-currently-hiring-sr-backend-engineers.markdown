Love microservices, NodeJS and distributed systems? Then we might have the right
opening for you!

<!-- more -->

Here at Namshi we're constantly trying to renovate our stack by using the best
from the open source ecosystem: from [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) to [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), our stack bleeds with
interesting tools to work with.

As a Sr. Backend Engineer, you'll be tasked to work on a spectrum of services
ranging from our customer-facing APIs to tools that power our logistics infrastructure.
We are a very pragmatic and experienced team, so from time to time you will see
engineers busy TDDing on a feature, whereas other times we're *straight to live*.
We pride of being a heterogeneous team that's experienced to know how and when to
abstract.

We run a Service-Oriented architecture with 100+ microservices where JS plays a
huge part: [our stack is comprised of many different tools](https://stackshare.io/namshi)
and we're always up to experimenting in light of new, harder challenges.

Some of the things our backend team has been working over the past few months:

* [rewriting one of our most sensitive APIs](/blog/2017/05/28/rewriting-the-catalog-api/), bringing the median response time down to 30ms
* moving [wonky pieces of our infrastructure](/blog/2017/02/06/towards-high-availability-and-beyond/) towards high-availability
* releasing some interesting open-source [backend bits](https://github.com/namshi/stackdriver-pushgateway)

Most of our backend apps are built with NodeJS, although some of the apps
still kick it in Symfony2 or pythonic boots. With a fleet of 100+ microservices, we're
generally very busy trying to innovate as much as possible -- and refactoring when
we need to pay our technical debt back.

Understand the HTTP protocol? Like deploying microservices on kubernetes? Async
programming doesn't scare you? Then we're definitely a match!

## Apply now!

P.S. A few months back I wrote a small piece about [Namshi's hiring process and *desiderata*](/blog/2016/12/06/get-that-job-at-namshi/),
give it a look!
