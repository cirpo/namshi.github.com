I am very happy to announce - even though I'm a bit late - that
[Luciano "unlucio" Colosio](https://twitter.com/unlucio)
is part of our crazy team!

He's been quite proficient in spreading JavaScript
all around his software architectures, thus we felt he
was a perfect match for Namshi: among his past creations
there's even a [REST driver for OrientDB](https://github.com/unlucio/MarcoPolo) in NodeJS.

Lucio will boost our frontend productivity bringing in
the software design skills we always like to welcome:
simplicity, clean code and good engineering.

(*...and they say he's a great chef!*)

You can read more about Lucio in his [personal blog](http://blog.unlucio.com/)
or...starting to check our [github page](https://github.com/namshi) out more often,
as I sense we're gonna see some more NodeJS there!
