The event, open to the public, will be held at our offices in Emaar Gold and Diamond Park,
(next to the FGB metro station, building #3, 2nd floor) and we'd gladly welcome anyone who
is interested to join: Luca will be talking about NoSQL databases in general, what are
multi-model DBs and will go through OrientDB, a new-generation
[graph database that's been in the news for quite some time](http://pettergraff.blogspot.ae/2013/12/orientdb-thanks.html).

What are you waiting for? RSVP to the [meetup](http://www.meetup.com/atthecribb/events/227245046/) and come join us!
