{% img left team /images/riaz.jpeg Muhammad Riaz %}

As much as we hate to see people leaving, I think
it's a good thing to waive the nostalgic feelings
and celebrate who has decided to move on: for better
or for worse, each and everyone in our team has played
a key role in evolving to what I call *"The tech family"*.

I must admit that I'm a bit late with saying goodbye to
[Muhammad](https://ae.linkedin.com/pub/muhammad-riaz/10/777/414), but I eventually wanted to do this as I believe
his mermerizing persona, the laugh, the commitment that
he showed in his 2-year tenure are second to none.

Muhammad has joined us even before I got to Dubai,
and left us after core contributions to our
architecture: from rushing to fix as many bugs as possible
to putting all he had in re-architecting core
components of our stack, like our main API and
integrations with payment providers: for example,
he's been crucial in implementing 3D-secure
authentication in our
[namshi/innovate](https://github.com/namshi/innovate) library.

Last we heard is that he would have rushed to Europe
in order to join an exciting startup.

Bring your [Kameez](http://www.stylehoster.com/lpc/uploads/2014/01/Latest-Salwar-Kameez-Designs-2014-For-Pakistani-Men.gif) with you man,
and remember you still have some brothers in Dubai!
