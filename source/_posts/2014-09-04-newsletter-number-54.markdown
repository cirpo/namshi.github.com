This week we've been quite busy, in fact we announced
that [Daniel is joining us](/blog/2014/08/31/welcome-daniel/) and
we took the time to talk about how we [process payments](/blog/2014/09/02/innovate-payment-gate-way-library/)
and how we've been trying to shift more to a 
[devops-ish culture](/blog/2014/09/01/5-devops-practices-you-should-consider-starting-today/) -- long road ahead though!

Last but not least, we also wrote an article explaining
[generators in PHP](/blog/2014/08/31/php-generators-explained/)
for whoever has missed them so far!

But what has the team been looking at over the past week? Below
you'll find the usual list of interesting articles we discovered
in the past 7 days.
