Just a heads up on a problem we've found
thanks to [Tim](http://www.timmclean.net/),
who has been reviewing some open source JWT / JWS
implementations for fun.

<!-- more -->

Two days ago we rolled out a few new tags for
the [namshi/jose](https://github.com/namshi/jose)
which fix a security vulnerability on the library.

The problem was introduced in [this PR](https://github.com/namshi/jose/pull/7)
and would cause an attacker to be able
to impersonate other users.

As far as your installations are concerned:

* `1.0` is not affected
* `1.1` has been patched through `1.1.2`
* `1.2` has been patched through `1.2.2`
* `2.0` has been patched through `2.0.3`
* `2.1` has been patched through `2.1.2`

Please check your `composer.lock` and `composer.json`:
if you run a vulnerable version simply do a `composer update`
so that you'll be upgraded to a patched version.

Users of the [LexikJwtAuthenticationBundle](https://github.com/lexik/LexikJWTAuthenticationBundle)
can do the same as the library requires `namshi/jose@~1.1`.

We also opened a [PR](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/security-advisories/pull/49) against the database of PHP security vulnerabilities
rrun by the FriendsOfPHP organization, so you should be able to notice the
issue through the [Sensio security checker](https://security.sensiolabs.org/check)
soon!
