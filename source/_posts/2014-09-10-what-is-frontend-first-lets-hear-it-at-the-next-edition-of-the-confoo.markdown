Just a heads up that we will have quite a few attempt
at "conquering" canada's hottest tech conference, and the
first to try is our [Mohammed](/team#Mohamad Hallal).

<!-- more -->

He has submitted a talk about [frontend-first](http://frontendfirst.com/)
and, if you'd like to hear him or want to support
our lebanese "rockstar", please [vote his talk](http://confoo.ca/en/call-for-papers/speaker/mohamad-hallal)
as ConFoo democratically selects them based on the attendees'
- or supposed attendees - feedback.

He will give an overview of what *frontend first* means and
how you can focus on the surface of your apps with tools
like [mockserver](https://github.com/namshi/mockserver).

See you in Montreal? :)
