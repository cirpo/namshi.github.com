Yesterday we got some cold breeze from Russia, which
is never bad considered that Dubai is getting ready
for the summer!

Nikita, one of our new API engineers, has joined the
team to feed our architecture with energy, good software engineering
and a ton of rock-solid PHP development!

You can get to know Nikita by checking out his [github profile](https://github.com/nikita2206),
a place where he likes to fork the official PHP repository
to fix bugs on the language itself (kudos!) or...by starting
to check our [github page](https://github.com/namshi) out more often,
as we're gonna see some more open-source PHP libraries over there!
