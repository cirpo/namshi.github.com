We are very excited to welcome [Daniel](/team#Daniel Ribeiro) in
the crazy Namshi family!

Daniel Ribeiro is a Technical Leader, Senior Software Engineer,
PHP 5.3 Zend Certified Engineer (ZEND021458), Speaker and
Evangelist from Brazil. Heâ€™s also a member of the local
PHP community (PHPSC), and has been working with software
engineering since 2006. His focus is on software engineering
best practices, both concerning the code and the process of
software development. He has a quite solid experience with agile
practices and leading development teams to enterprise application
standards and practices. Technically, he works with a lot of
best practices, such as Behavior-Driven Development (BDD). He
also has a background on architecture patterns, such as Domain
Driven Design (DDD) and Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). He
loves to work with high quality code, especially concerning
advanced software engineering concepts, such as the SOLID
principles and the GoF design patterns.

I am personally very excited as Daniel and me have been
talking about working together for a while, and we finally
managed to get a chance of getting hands down to the code
together!

He will bring good seniority to our team as well as good
knowledge of best practices and enterprise *modus operandi*;
last but not least, Daniel has been eager to accept the challenge
of taking a closer look at NodeJS as it's getting bigger and
bigger in our stack.

Looking forward to get the brazilian vibes at our desks!
