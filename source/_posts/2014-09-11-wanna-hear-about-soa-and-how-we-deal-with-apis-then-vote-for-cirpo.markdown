Aaaaand following our first announcement
regarding ["conquering" the ConFoo](/blog/2014/09/10/what-is-frontend-first-lets-hear-it-at-the-next-edition-of-the-confoo/),
as promised, we go ahead with the second
charge!

[Cirpo](/team) has decided to capitalize on
the opportunity of being in the cold lands of
Canada to offer **a few** learning opportunities
for the attendees, as
[the list of his proposals](http://confoo.ca/en/call-for-papers/speaker/alessandro-cinelli)
is quite long and impressive.

If you are willing to hear how we do web services
and how we integrated an **API-first** approach then
don't miss the opportunity to rate his talks, as I'm
sure he'd be happy to showcase our best practices and
hear your feedbacks and suggestions, to make Namshi's
SOA even sharper; along with these topics he'll be
happy to talk about some of the other tools and systems
we use like Redis and RabbitMQ.

But even more important, [grab your ticket](http://confoo.ca/en/register) for the
event as I can ensure you it's one of a kind and you won't
regret it!
