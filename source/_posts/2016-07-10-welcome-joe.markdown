Fresh new vibes in the tech team as
Joe joined us a today!

{% img right /images/joe.png %}

Joe, from Haiti, holds a B.S. in Computer Science from NYU Abu Dhabi.
He loves building software that make people's lives easier, and is always looking
for opportunities to improve his programming skills, whether it is by participating at a
hackathon, working on a side project, or doing technical internships.

His technical skills include Python, JavaScript, C, Flask, Django, HTML, CSS,
Heroku, AWS and more -- however, he is language agnostic, so he likes to use the
right tool for the given task.

When he is not solving technical problems, you can find him reading a personal
development book or riding a bike.

Welcome amongst the Namshees!
