This week one of our teammates left the team
to pursuit his next big challenge: we are talking
about [Luciano](http://tech.namshi.io/team/#Luciano Amodio)
who is now in Spain, hacking, as usual, with
JavaScript.

<!-- more -->

*Lucianino*, as we liked to call him, has been
instrumental in kicking off
our whole "frontend" department, and we have been
very happy to have him here, introducing us to
the magical world of AngularJS, Grunt (even though
we now use Gulp) and Single-Page Apps.

While at Namshi, we've seen him transitioning
from the (traditional) world of PHP to JavaScript
and even giving his very [first talk at a conference](http://www.slideshare.net/adamquadmon/angular-js-mobile-jsday-2014-verona-14-may).

We really want to thank him for what he has done
in the past 12 months at Namshi and wish him
good luck for his next adventure!
