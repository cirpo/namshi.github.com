It's gonna be a great time in Las Vegas for
[Oba](/team#Oluwaseun Obajobi), our Lead
System Administrator, who is going to attend
the 2014 edition of [AWS re:invent](https://reinvent.awsevents.com/),
the international event for the cloud lovers.

<!-- more -->

re:invent, which is gonna gather professionals from
all over the world, is definitely going to be a great
source of inspiration for our systems, and we're
very happy to have someone who will be able
to get a closer look at best practices, processes
and tools in the industry; to learn from the community
and the industry leaders is something we value very
much, here at Namshi.

Never heard of re:invent before?
