Gabriel is a Frontend Engineer, who holds a B.Sc in Engineering from University
of Ibadan Nigeria.

He loves to build products that are functional, beautiful and easy to use.
His main focus is Frontend development (a lot of Javascript, HTML, CSS, Sass…)
and some UX to go with it (on the server NodeJS and basic PHP).

He loves challenging myself to do more and push beyond the limits.
His best quote is “*if you do it right, it would last forever – Massimo Vignelli*”

Welcome amongst the Namshees!
