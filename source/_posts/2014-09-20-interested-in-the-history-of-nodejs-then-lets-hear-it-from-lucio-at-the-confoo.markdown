Not really hard to believe, NodeJS is a beloved one among
the plethora of technologies that we use at [Namshi](https://namshi.com);
that's why we got people like [Lucio](/team#Luciano Colosio) on board so that we
could expand in that direction.

And you know what? Lucio loves Node so much that he'd like
to talk about it at a big stage, like the one the
[ConFoo](http://confoo.ca/) of next february.

Then don't miss the chance to
[vote one of his proposals](http://confoo.ca/en/call-for-papers/speaker/luciano-colosio)
as he'd be very happy to introduce you the history of NodeJS
(I heard part of that talk, since he already gave it internally
for the Namshi team, and I have to admit it was freaking
interesting), how it was born and what pushed
[Rian Dahl](http://www.quora.com/Who-is-Ryan-Dahl) to write
this beautiful platform; the other talk that he has in the
pipeline is a good introduction on how to embrace the
non-blocking paradigm and he will explain how to make sure
that you treat the Event Loop responsibly :)

Definitely worth it!
