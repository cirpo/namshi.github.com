Without even realizing it, we've come quite far with our small,
weekly newsletter: to celebrate it's 100th edition I'd like to
spend a few words on how meaningful this platform is to us.

<!-- more -->

It's been more than a year since we've started sharing to the
outside world stuff that we, [Namshees](http://tech.namshi.io/team/),
find useful; our very first public newsletter went out in
[January last year](http://tech.namshi.io/blog/2014/01/23/newsletter-number-23/)
after we kept it in-between us for 5 months or so.

The Namshi team has seen people [coming](http://tech.namshi.io/blog/categories/welcome/)
and going, but we always made sure that everyone who would come
on board would bring the right mindset to work altogether:
being hungry of knowledge, passionate about helping others
and having a good chunk of personal interest towards *nerdy things*.

It doesn't matter whether your English isn't perfect or you
haven't been using JavaScript until yesterday: what we really
value is the spirit, the commitment and the passion that people
put in everyday; being it in one of our projects, when discussing
an approach with a teammate, while showcasing a design pattern to
a junior member of the team or by striving to make an
[open-source library](https://github.com/namshi?utf8=%E2%9C%93&query=+only%3Apublic+)
out of one of our internal projects.

And this last point is very important to us, bright and bold:
**open-source is king**.

We bleed it, we rely on it so much and we've come a long way
thanks to what other great engineers have done throughout
many years.

If Namshi is here, we owe a **huge** "*thank you*" to the OS community;
and by open-sourcing [this blog](https://github.com/namshi/namshi.github.com), what [we share](http://tech.namshi.io/archives/) and a [few, small libraries](https://github.com/namshi?utf8=%E2%9C%93&query=+only%3Apublic+)
we hope to give back to the community at least 1% of what we got
during our careers.

Last but not least, this is still *#techThursday*!
