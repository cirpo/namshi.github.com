Folks, time for a quick one!

[Javier](https://connect.sensiolabs.com/profile/javier.eguiluz)
from SensioLabs was kind enough to ask whether we had some
interesting feedbacks about using Symfony2 in an SOA, and
that led to writing a small write-up about our experience.

So, head over to the Symfony blog to read how things
are panning out after [a year and a half of SOA with
Symfony2](http://symfony.com/blog/going-soa-with-symfony2-a-year-and-a-half-down-the-road).
