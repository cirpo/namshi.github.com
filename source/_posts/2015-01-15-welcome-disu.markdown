Disu joined the *systeam* a few days back in order
to kickstart his career as a desktop support
engineer and with the aim of turning himself
into a code geek someday.

He is currently studying for a Masterâ€™s Degree
in IT Management from the University of Wollongong
and we wish him all the best for a great start of
his career!
