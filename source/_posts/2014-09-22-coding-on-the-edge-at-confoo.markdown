[Alex](http://tech.namshi.io/team#Alessandro Nadalin) submitted a bunch of talks to the 2015 edition of the Confoo conference, so just
[vote for his talks](http://confoo.ca/en/call-for-papers/speaker/alessandro-nadalin).<br>
His talks cover a wide variety of topics from Symfony, Angular, HTTP to Dockerinzing your application.

How cool is that?<br>
If you are looking for sharp and engaging sessions, **these are definitely bound to make you sit up and notice**.
