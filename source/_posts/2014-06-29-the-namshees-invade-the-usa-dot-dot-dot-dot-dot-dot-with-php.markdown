If you're a geek somewhere around Boston, in September,
you definitely don't want to miss the
[PHP North East](http://www.northeastphp.org/)
conference, which has an amazing lineup of
[speakers](http://www.northeastphp.org/speakers)
and [a surprise](http://www.northeastphp.org/speakers/view/176/Alessandro-Cinelli)
from Dubai.

Among the plethora of [interesting talks](http://www.northeastphp.org/agenda)
there will be a (definitely) fun one, "[PHP is the king, NodeJS the price and Lua
is the fool](http://www.northeastphp.org/talks/view/352/PHP-is-the-king-nodejs-is-the-prince-and-Lua-is-the-fool)"
given by our [Cirpo](<http://tech.namshi.io/team/#Alessandro Cinelli (cirpo)>) who will entertain the crowd with some
details on how we mesh a whole lot of languages and platforms
together.

Namshi's SOA is currently running on at least 4 different
application platforms and Cirpo took the opportunity to share some insights
about how we are doing it: it will be a *hands-on* talk focused on
decision-making, benefits and pitfalls of running such a heterogeneous
architecture and how crazy ideas (like flirting with Lua) could be a
game-changer in your next long-term project.

Cirpo is no newbie to the world of speaking, as he already delivered
a few talks in the past and, [judging by the ratings](https://joind.in/user/view/956),
has a track record of nothing but success. Being a leader, at Namshi, doesn't mean
to only set the tone for our team, but also to confront with the community,
explain (and validate) our infrastructure and learn from the feedbacks we get back:
Cirpo knows that very well and this will be a great experience from this
standpoint.


We wish him a safe trip to the U.S. and wish **you** can
attend his talk!
