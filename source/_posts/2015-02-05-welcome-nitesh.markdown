Introducing new team members is
always a good way to end a week!

<!-- more -->

This time it's Nitesh's turn, an
experienced JavaScripter from India!

> Nitesh is a quite introvert software developer who also believes has good taste in design.
> He is very interested in software design practices, TDD and stuff like meditation.
> He is in the software industries for around 5 years and mainly focused on enterprise javascript applications which allowed him to witness, from the front seat, the evolution of javascript from browser compatibilty hell to crazy stuff it does these days
> In his free time you might find him traveling, reading books or fancy about human phycology. 

Nitesh has joined us a few days back and
has already showed signs of his peculiar
attention to software design and elegant
solutions, so we're sure he's going to be
having a lot of fun in our SOA!
