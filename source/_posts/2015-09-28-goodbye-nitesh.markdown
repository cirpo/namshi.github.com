Today, Nitesh is leaving us to go back to his homeland, India,
shift away from programming and focus on some other of his
interests!

He had a few words to share with everyone:

{% blockquote %}
When I came to Namshi, they handed me this welcome package which has small memo regarding values of the company, having worked before in corporate jobs I knew what it means, formality !! so I read the first line and toss it out. after working here for a while I could say there is nothing describe Namshi tech team better than that first line of that memo:

Do more with less.

Around 15 peoples tech team, building and scaling a growing e-commerce business like Namshi, says a lot about the quality of people. What makes it even more rewarding is the diversity of team, Italian, Egyptian, Indian, Nigerian ... soon enough the conditioning of your own culture start to crack ( or at-least become more visible ).
Being nomad from heart, and contemplative in nature, this was the most pleasing aspect of Namshi for me.

There was a striking combination of depth and breadth of knowledge in Namshi. always being more of a depth guy, I enjoyed things like test driven development and refactoring until my heart content, while some of my other colleagues seems like expert in everything.
This leads to a solid Yin and yang approach. I was amused to know that our lead appreciates both. And quite excellent in walking the middle path.

These 9 months felt like 9 weeks in Namshi and with every meditation session, I knew I want to chew life, not really sprint through it.
So even though I am engrossed and indulged in all this, I decided to move on.

Good luck Nitesh!
