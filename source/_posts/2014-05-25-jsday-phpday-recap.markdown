One week ago, Luciano, Lucio, Alex and I attended the annual [jsDay](http://jsday.it) and [phpDay](http://phpday.it) in Verona organized by the [GrUSP](http://grusp.it), the Italian PHP user Group.
It was a nice experience in the beautiful city of Verona, and an opportunity to meet interesting people from international communities while attending the talks during those 4 days.<br />
The conferences were sold out, with more than 300 attendees and two tracks per day. Kudos and props to the organizers!

There were other presentations worth mentioning:

##phpDay
[The opening keynote](http://talks.php.net/phpday14#/) was addressed by Rasmus Lerdord (the PHP creator), showing us an interesting, and sometimes passionate, overview of what’s new in PHP 5.6 and the technical/design choices behind it.

Alex and I gave a talk about “How to build **durable** web apis” based on our experience at Namshi while
building our Service Oriented Architechture.

##Join communities!

Attending conferences that are community driven like jsDay and phpDay
are always a great moment to improve yourself as a developer and they give you the possibility to be part of the community.
You have the chance to understand what’s going on in our field, talk in person with other devs that maybe you just know because you sent a PR to their awesome opensource project on Github, getting tons of advices and inspiration and so on.
Keep following [@TechNamshi](http://twitter.com/technamshi) on twitter, a **new community** is coming in Dubai... **stay tuned!**

Follow [@jsday](http://twitter.com/jsconfit) and [@phpday](http://twitter.com/phpday) to stay updated on when they are going to release the talks videos.
