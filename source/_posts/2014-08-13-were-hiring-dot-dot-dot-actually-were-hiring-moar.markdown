Just an heads up that we are looking for talented
engineers for our tech team, and our guys are very
sad they don't have too many new friends!

<!-- more -->

Besides looking for a Lead Mobile developer, as we
[announced a few weeks back](/blog/2014/06/03/like-android-and-ios-lets-change-shopping-in-the-middle-east-together/),
we are looking for some other key figures in our team.

## No HTML/CSS love...

Our frontend team, usually happy to write AngularJS
directives or a bunch of frontend-ish NodeJS apps,
is devastated as they feel they are missing a third
element who can help them achieve greatness.

To make Lucio and Shidhin happy, we want to add a new
member in our team, a **Frontend Developer**, someone who
is skilled on HTML5 and CSS3 and knows the basics of
JavaScript but wants to expand his knowledge in that
direction.

You will work on a whole lot of new internal applications
as well as help streamlining our frontend processes, together
with the rest of the team: which frameworks shall we use? Bootstrap or
Foundation? How can we use Yeoman's generator to speed up
most of our code generation? How can we make our web apps
faster [extracting critical styles](https://github.com/addyosmani/critical)
and so on? These are just a few questions you will need to
ask yourself once you come here.

You will come here knowing how to design a frontend (mastering
the presentation layer, so HTML, CSS, jQuery) but will leave Namshi
knowing how to build the presentation and logic behind a full
frontend application (AngularJS, Node or something more spicy
like [polymer](http://www.polymer-project.org/)).

## Sitting on an empty (sysadmin) chair...

Look at the systeam, so sad: they really
need some new buddy for their games.

The chair is empty, and that makes me so sad! If only
we could find someone who would like to come and join
the hottest SOA of the Middle East...

So yeah, we're also looking for a **System Administrator**,
someone who knows how configuration management works,
who has relevant experience on cloud infrastructures as
AWS and wants to use some of the latest technologies, like
Docker or Deis, to help us automate and scale the hell out
of our architecture; we are trying to switch towards a more
devops oriented organization, and need someone with that
mindset to improve the current state of the team: as an example,
we use [serverspec](http://serverspec.org/) to test some of
our configurations, and would like someone who can get his/her
hands dirty with both programming and system administration
to help the team.

## I don't know if he's crying because of lonelyness of because of NodeJS...

Look at how sad Cirpo, our lead API engineer, was
today:

{% img center /images/cirpo-sad.png %}

It's true that he might be sad because we decided
to use a lot of NodeJS instead of PHP, but I
think his struggles also come from the fact that he feels
we need a good **Senior Software engineer**, specialized in
NodeJS, who can help the team getting more skilled with
this "new" platform.

The ideal candidate would have a few years of experience
on production-ready Node systems, and it would be a great
plus if we can get someone who has a broader experience
with different programming paradigms, as we feel the most
important part of this job is the brain, and it would be great
if we get someone that has been in a few different battlefields :)

We need someone who first solves the problem, then writes the
code (or, even better: first solves the problem, then writes the
test, then the code :-D).
