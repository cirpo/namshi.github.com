The team at Namshi is always on the go with some new open source project
that lights up our weekends or solves some of the small dilemmas we daily
face at work.

<!-- more -->

In the past days [Lucio](http://tech.namshi.com/team/#Luciano Colosio)
has been working on one of his side projects and released
[CarmenSandiego](https://github.com/unlucio/carmensandiego) on Github:
it lets you visualize your 4Square checkins on a map
[in a matter of a few steps](https://github.com/unlucio/carmensandiego#so-heres-how-you-do-it),
and it has been written in his beloved NodeJS.

Kudos to Lucio for releasing his work and...   ...more to come!
