Second announcement of the day (and we ain't done yet!):
I am super-duper-excited to welcome [Shidhin CR](https://twitter.com/shidhincr)
in the family!

Shidhin has been working at FlipKart for a while and,
as soon as we got to know each other, found an immediate
connection: cutting edge technologies meet a cutting-edge, motivated
brain. He will be part of our *Frontend Engineering* team,
helping on AngularJS, some of the frontend design and
JavaScript in general (Did I mention [we love JavaScript?](/blog/2014/03/24/looking-for-some-fun-with-apis-or-javascript-we-have-what-you-need/)).

As he describes himself:

*I am is a senior Front end developer, passionate about latest UI best practices and front end technologies. I have over 6 years of experience in front end development, and core JavaScript expertise. In the free time, I can be found updating my blog or checking out some open source stuff.*

You can read more about Shidhin in his [personal blog](http://www.undefinednull.com/)
or...starting to check our [github page](https://github.com/namshi) out more often,
as we're gonna see some more AngularJS-ish stuff over there!
