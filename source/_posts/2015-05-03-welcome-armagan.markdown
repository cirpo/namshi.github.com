Time for another terrific addition to
the team as we're trying to embrace
the DevOps culture over here!

We've been trying to make some key
hires over the past few months,
and after beefing up the team with
[talented JavaScripters](http://tech.namshi.com/blog/2015/02/05/welcome-nitesh/),
[diligent (and very funny!) webdevelopers](http://tech.namshi.com/blog/2014/12/29/welcome-amin/)
and experienced [software engineers](http://tech.namshi.com/blog/2014/12/29/welcome-filippo/),
we felt we needed to add someone with
DevOps in his blood to help our whole
team in this long, rewarding transition.

Without further ado, we welcome [Armagan](https://twitter.com/armagan_kim)
from Turkey, our very first 100% turk! :)

Well, best of luck Arma! And thanks for the
