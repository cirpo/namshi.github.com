Pretty excited that we are going to be present
at the [Symfony Live](http://london2014.live.symfony.com/)
which will happen at the end of this month, in London.

<!-- more -->

[Mohamad](/team#mohamad hallal), who has been quite
productive lately - both with [blogging](http://mohdhallal.github.io/)
and releasing some open source libraries (like
[mockserver](https://github.com/namshi/mockserver) and [shisha](https://github.com/namshi/shisha)) -
has decided to take advantage of one of the bonuses that
we are offering -- tickets for conferences!

He will have the chance to get to meet the leaders in the
PHP community in one of the most amazing conferences the
PHP panorama can offer.

We wish Hallal a safe trip to the United Kingdom
and we hope he'll have a blast learning some new stuff
and seeing a new place!
