...it's always a joy, full of surprises: what they don't tell you
is that not all of the surprises are much fun.

Kudos to [Mohamad](http://tech.namshi.io/team/#Mohamad Hallal)
who shared his [10 most dramatic moments as a Junior software engineer](http://mohdhallal.github.io/blog/2014/06/18/my-top-10-junior-developer-pitfalls/)
in his latest blog post: the whole team at Namshi had so much fun going through
it because:

* we heard him shouting at Vim
* we've all been there :)

...and what about you? Which ones were your biggest #EPICFAIL?

On a side note, it's great to see how passionate engineers like
Mohamad grown on a daily basis -- especially compared to the
"old guys" like me: one of his open source libraries,
[Mockserver](https://github.com/namshi/mockserver),
is definitely something you should check out.
