A quick update from the trenches: for the past months
we've been beefing our team up and by doing so we
realized that some good coding challenges are 
almost a must.

We just put all the challenges we've used and are gonna
be using on a [github repo for you to check them out](https://github.com/namshi/coding-challenges):
feel free to solve them, fork them, improve them, do anything
with them! :)

We are currently hiring [senior API engineers](https://github.com/namshi/coding-challenges/blob/master/senior-api-engineer.md), [senior frontend
engineers](https://github.com/namshi/coding-challenges/blob/master/senior-frontend-engineer.md) and are looking to bootstrap our mobile team
with a [Lead Mobile Engineer](https://github.com/namshi/coding-challenges/blob/master/lead-mobile-engineer.md):
got leads? Got skills? Reach out and let's do Service-Oriented Architectures together!
