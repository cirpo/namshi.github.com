Whether you are an API maniac or you like to get your hands dirty on
the Chrome DevTools, trying to optimize a bunch of JavaScript code, love the opensource,
get excited about new tools and technologies (Docker, HHVM anyone?),
if you are passionate and enthusiast about what you're doing... 
**then we should have a chat!**

At Namshi we are always looking for talented individuals who want to strive
towards clean code, design patterns and want to use the latest
technologies in their daily work -- ever heard of **SPDY, WebP, AngularJS, Docker, ElasticSearch or Redis? These
are just a few of the things we use at Namshi**.

## About our stack

On the backend, we like to use **NodeJS, Symfony2** and have based our
Service Oriented Architecture on "RESTish" APIs, while, at the front,
we've decided to fight the battle with AngularJS and Javascript in general
(gulp, browserify and all the *new kids on the block*).

We are also using other cool tools in our architecture: RabbitMq, ElasticSearch, Docker, Mysql, Redis

## What do we offer?

...a good salary, we don't want to hire people who feel they've been underpaid

...an opensource-community-driven environment. We love to give back to the community whenever we can: http://github.com/namshi

...SPDY, HTTP APIs and a Service-Oriented Architecture

...the *"10th our breakpoint"*: if you work for 10 hours then have a break, order food and we will reimburse it
