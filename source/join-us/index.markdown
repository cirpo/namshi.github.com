Whether you are an API maniac or you like to get your hands dirty on
the Chrome DevTools, trying to optimize a bunch of JavaScript code,
if you are passionate and enthusiast about what you're doing...then
we should have a chat!

At Namshi we are always looking for talented individuals who want to strive
towards clean code, design patterns and want to use the latest
technologies in their daily work -- ever heard of SPDY, WebP, AngularJS or Redis? These
are just a few of the things we use at Namshi.

On the backend, we like to use NodeJS, Symfony2 and have based our
Service Oriented Architecture on "RESTish" APIs, while, at the front,
we've decided to fight the battle with AngularJS and Javascript in general
(gulp, browserify and all the *new kids on the block*).

For this year, we've planned great things:

and want **you** as part of our amazing
tech team.

Here's a taste of Namshi, as a company:
